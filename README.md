# comp_systems_project

This project was completed during the UChicago class "Machine Learning for Computer Systems". With a partner, I trained a machine learning model to predict the category "country of origin" for mobile apps, based on a dataset from nprint.

The project consists of the following parts: Load Libraries, Load Data, Feature Selection, Model Selection and Training, and Final Model Training and Tuning. I used both supervised and unsupervised models, including PCA, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and GMM.

Our AUCs, as pictured on the final page of the pdf, provide a picture of the success of our model.
